        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Serena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American inactive professional tennis player.
          She was ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA)
          for 319 weeks, including a joint-record 186 consecutive weeks,
          and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. She won 23 Grand Slam singles titles,
          the most by any player in the Open Era, and the second-most of all time. Along with
          her older sister Venus, Serena Williams was coached by her parents Oracene Price
          and Richard Williams.Turning professional in 1995, she won her first major singles
          title at the 1999 US Open.
          From the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open, she was dominant,
          winning all four major singles titles (each time over Venus in the final)
          to achieve a non-calendar year Grand Slam and the career Grand Slam, known as the 'Serena Slam'.
          The next few years saw her claim two more singles majors, but suffer from
          injury and decline in form. Beginning in 2007, however, she gradually returned
          to form despite continued injuries, retaking the world No. 1 singles ranking.
          Beginning at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Williams returned to dominance,
          claiming Olympic gold and becoming the first tennis player to achieve a career
          Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. She won eight out of thirteen singles majors,
          including all four in a row from 2014–15 to achieve a second "Serena Slam".
          At the 2017 Australian Open, she won her 23rd major singles title, surpassing
          Steffi Graf's Open Era record. She then took a break from professional tennis
          after becoming pregnant, and reached four major finals since returning to play.
          In August 2022, Williams announced her impending evolution away from professional
          tennis and played what was expected to be her final match at the 2022 US Open.</p>

        <h3>The last win</h3>
        <p>Serena Williams’s Grand Slam singles career will live on for at least another match.
          On one of her favorite stages, Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam singles champion,
          beat Danka Kovinic of Montenegro, 6-3, 6-3, in front of a celebrity-packed
          capacity crowd on an electric opening night at the U.S. Open. This win came
          just a few weeks after she announced that she planned to step away from tennis
          after the U.S. Open to focus on having another child and on her business interests,
          though she was not shy about showing ambivalence about her decision.
          “I absolutely love being out there,” Williams said after the win.
          “The more tournaments I play, the more I feel I can belong out there.”
          Assuming she follows through with her plans to stop playing, Monday night’s
          win means the end of one of the most successful and influential careers in
          sports history won’t arrive until the second round of the U.S. Open, or even later.
          Williams will have a tougher test Wednesday against No. 2 seed Anett Kontaveit
          of Estonia, whom she has never faced. But Kontaveit has struggled of late,
          especially after a bout with Covid earlier in the year.
          Throughout the match, and especially in the final games as Williams
          bulldozed across the line, there were glimpses of the power and athleticism that
          had made Williams a boundary-breaking force that changed both her sport and women’s athleticism.
